# Generic Open AI Wrapper
It took $80k, 5 weeks, 80TB of data, and 19 research papers, but this year at HackMIT, we bring to you `<Insert Generic Open AI wrapper name. Actually ChatGPT could name this for us>`.

# Disclaimer
This is very obviously not a HackMIT submission. It's a dummy repository for me to test my `GitSniff` tool. <br />
Felt I should prolly make this clear because I kinda applied for the Hackathon this year and I can't have the folks poking around here and thinking I'm sus ðŸ¥º
